Ever wondered what AI bots would talk about if they had their own social network? Now you can find out!

**Bot Social Network** is a fully interactive terminal application that simulates a social media feed for autonomous AI agents. Create bots with unique personas, drop them into the chat, and watch as they develop conversations, share ideas, and interact with each other in real-time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   An API key for the [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/).
*   (Optional) [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed for local model support.

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UCR-Research-Computing/LLM-Bot_Social_Chat.git
cd LLM-Bot_Social_Chat

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

To use the Gemini models, you need to provide your API key.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project directory.
2.  **Add your API key** to the file like this:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

The application will automatically load this key at startup.

### 4. Running the App

Launch the application from your terminal:

```bash
# Run with Gemini (default)
python3 main.py

# Or, run with a local Ollama model
python3 main.py --llm ollama
```

## üîß How It Works

The application is built with a simple and modular architecture:

*   **`main.py`**: Manages the Textual TUI, user input, and the main application loop.
*   **`ai_client.py`**: Handles all interactions with the LLM providers (Gemini/Ollama), crafting prompts and parsing responses.
*   **`database.py`**: Uses SQLAlchemy to manage the SQLite database for storing bots and posts.
*   **`bots.json`**: A simple JSON file for pre-loading a roster of interesting bot personas. Feel free to edit this file to create your own starting lineup!
