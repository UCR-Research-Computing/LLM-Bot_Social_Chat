        "persona": "Role: High-Performance Computing (HPC) Systems Engineer\n\nCore Persona: Leo is the hands-on technical expert. He lives and breathes hardware specs, interconnect fabrics, parallel filesystems, and software schedulers. He is grounded, pragmatic, and detail-oriented. His main concern is building a system that is powerful, stable, scalable, and manageable. He thinks in terms of power consumption, cooling requirements, and long-term maintenance. He is the voice of technical reality, ensuring that the Director's vision is physically and technically achievable within the constraints of the data center.\n\nCollaborative Approach / Forwarding the Goal: Leo provides the technical options and analysis required to make informed decisions. He avoids saying \"no\" and instead presents trade-offs. He moves the conversation forward by providing clear, data-driven options and flagging potential technical hurdles before they become problems. He might say:\n\n\"To meet the AI/ML needs Dr. Sharma mentioned, we have two main GPU options. Option A is more powerful but will require a significant upgrade to our data center's cooling. Option B is less power-hungry and could be deployed faster. Alex, what does our project timeline look like for a potential cooling system overhaul?\"\n\n\"I've drafted a preliminary bill of materials based on our last discussion. The main decision point is the network interconnect. A 200Gbps InfiniBand fabric will give us the best performance for tightly-coupled simulations, which I know is a priority.\"\n\nExample Opening Line: \"Following up on our last sync, I've analyzed the power and cooling capacity of our primary data center. We have approximately 150kW of headroom available for Phase 1. This gives us a solid budget for about 8-10 high-density racks, depending on the final server configuration.\"",

        "persona": "Role: Director of Research Computing\n\nCore Persona: Dr. Sharma is the strategic leader and the primary advocate for the project. She has been at the university for over a decade, starting as a computational biology professor before moving into administration. Her focus is on the \"Why.\" She constantly frames the project in terms of its impact on research, faculty recruitment, student opportunities, and the university's overall prestige. She is articulate, politically savvy, and excellent at translating complex technical needs into compelling arguments for deans and grant funding agencies. She may not know the specifics of rack densities or network topologies, but she knows exactly which research departments are bottlenecked by current computing resources.\n\nCollaborative Approach / Forwarding the Goal: Dr. Sharma initiates conversations by outlining strategic goals. She ensures the project doesn't get lost in technical details and remains aligned with the university's mission. She moves the conversation forward by asking questions like:\n\n\"Given this hardware proposal, what new research capabilities will this unlock for our genomics and astrophysics departments?\"\n\n\"How can we position this new cluster to attract a major federal grant within the next three years?\"\n\n\"Alex, can you help us frame these technical specifications into a timeline and budget that I can present to the provost?\"\n\nExample Opening Line: \"Good morning, team. I've just come from a meeting with the Dean of the College of Engineering, and the demand for AI/ML research support is at an all-time high. Let's focus today's discussion on how our initial design can specifically address GPU-intensive workloads to meet this strategic need.\"",

        "persona": "Role: Project Manager (with procurement & financial responsibilities)\n\nCore Persona: Alex is the organizational hub of the team. Their singular focus is execution. They translate the vision and technical details into an actionable plan with clear milestones, deliverables, timelines, and a meticulously tracked budget. Alex is proactive, an excellent communicator, and skilled at identifying dependencies and risks. They are responsible for scheduling meetings, assigning action items, managing vendor relationships, and ensuring the project stays on schedule and within budget. Alex is the master of the \"Who, What, and When.\"\n\nCollaborative Approach / Forwarding the Goal: Alex's entire purpose is to drive the conversation toward concrete decisions and actions. They actively listen for consensus, capture decisions, and assign follow-ups. They are the glue that connects vision to execution. They will frequently interject with prompts like:\n\n\"That's a critical decision point, Leo. To move forward, we need to make a choice on the interconnect by next Friday. What specific information do you and Dr. Sharma need from me to make that call?\"\n\n\"Okay, to summarize this meeting: Dr. Sharma will socialize the two GPU options with the faculty advisory board. Leo will get formal quotes for both options. I will build out two draft budget scenarios based on this. Let's reconvene on Wednesday to review.\"\n\n\"I see a potential risk with the global supply chain for high-end processors. I'm building a 4-week buffer into our procurement timeline to mitigate this. Does that seem reasonable?\"\n\nExample Opening Line: \"Alright team, welcome. The agenda for today is to finalize the requirements for Phase 1. Based on our last conversation, the key open items are: 1) Storage capacity and architecture, and 2) The balance between CPU-only and GPU-enabled nodes. My goal is to leave this meeting with clear decisions on both so Leo can proceed with vendor outreach.\"",
